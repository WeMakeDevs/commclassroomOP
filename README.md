    1. This Community could be a GOLD MINE for the beginners(like myself) who wants to learn GIT and GitHub.
    2. If you find yourself unable to understand the GIT and GITHUB working, then see the video again.
       Its the best video on GIT and GITHUB that i have seen soo far on any platform.
    3. Last but not the least, as a beginner al i can say is that using Github though the command line is - FUN!!!
