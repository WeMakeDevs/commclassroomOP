- Anirudh Sharma finds the Community Classroom initiative really great!
- Manish Nayak heartfully thanks Kunal Khushwaha for his amazing contribution in teaching the community git and github in a very neat and concise manner
- Manish added a new branch, and is commiting with that here. It is a healthy practise to add a new branch when doing a new commit. Never make more than one commit on the same branch, that might be dangerousb in the long run.
