- Basic Information about pull request(PR)
- PR is mechanism for proposing changes to git repo typically in Open-source proj / Collaboration
  
                     ************ Steps in PR ********************

  Step 1 : Fork a original git repo from maintainer's account 
           As we can't directly access the original git repo from maintainer's account

  Step 2 : Make changes on github / Clone forked repo on local device and then make changes

  Step 3 : After making chnages commit it (If you are working on github)
           otherwise push (If you are on your local device)

  Step 4 : Creating a pull request that is formal request to maintainer of original repo 
           for merging your changes to original repo 

  Step 5 : If all is well as per maintainer then maintainer will merge you branch in original master branch          
  In such way pull request works.
