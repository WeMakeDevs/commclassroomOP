# Community Classroom is OP

- Kunal Kushwaha says that this community is amazing.
- Kunal made this change
- I love MLH
- More power to kunal. love the work which your are doing for the community.-I really appreciate what Kunal is doing. I am a mechanical student, who is try to learn programming.The motivation he gave me that if he can do it, then why not me.

I find it very difficult first, like how to make changes because, I was not able to write in the file, but after hit and trial, I find the solution. So, do not stress out first if you are not able to write or exit with saving
To save and exit the file:
* hit the Esc botton( this lead to the bottom __INSERT__ cloumn
* Then type :x
* Hit the Enter button (it's done)
If you want to exit but do not want to save any changes or you haven't done any changes.
* Try to type :q  after first step of above instruction instead of :x
and then hit enter.

:-tip: if you are beginner, no doubt kunal have a vast knowledge of this field but, he can't put his 4 year of full knowldege and experince in 1 hour 16 minute video, he may skip some point what he find very easy, but difficult to you, try to search on google, that's the beauty of computer science, you have the vast community and resources to help and support.So, learn instead of giving up, :-)
